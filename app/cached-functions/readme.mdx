- Mark a regular function as _cacheable_ by adding the `use cache` directive to the top of the function definition.
- When a cacheable function is called with the same inputs, it reuses the cached result if it exists, otherwise it runs and caches the output.

# !!col

```tsx app/page.tsx
async function getData() {
  // !mark
  'use cache';
  // ...
}

async function ProductList() {
  const products = await getData();
  // ...
}

export default async function Page() {
  return <ProductList />;
}
```

</Grid>

### Demo

- The data fetching function to get the list of products is annotated with `use cache`.
- An artificial one second delay is added to the function to make the difference more noticeable.
- Since the function is cacheable, the delay only happens the first time the function is called.
- `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx` and `<ProductList>` aren't explicitly annotated with `use cache`, but Next.js infers they're static because they do not use any Dynamic APIs. If they started to, Next.js will guide the developer to either add `use cache` or a `<Suspense>` boundary.

### Notes

- The `use cache` directive enables caching at the function level for expensive computations.
- Cache keys are derived from function arguments, so ensure inputs are serializable.

### Key Takeaways

| Topic | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Granularity | Cache expensive helper functions |
| Determinism | Only cache pure, input-driven results |
| Performance | Reduces repeated data fetching |

### Pitfalls & Tips

- Avoid caching when results depend on auth/session state.
- Ensure inputs are serializable and stable.

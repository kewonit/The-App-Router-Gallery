  DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE
  
  This template defines the standard structure for all readme.mdx files.
  Every demo should follow this pattern for consistency and quality.
  
  REQUIRED IMPORTS:
  - db from '#/lib/db' for dynamic title
  - Grid from '#/ui/codehike' for side-by-side explanation + code
  - FlowDiagram from '#/ui/flow-diagram' for visual summaries
*/}

import db from '#/lib/db';
import { Grid } from '#/ui/codehike';
import { FlowDiagram } from '#/ui/flow-diagram';

{/* Dynamic title from database - ensures consistency with navigation */}
export const demo = db.demo.find({ where: { slug: 'DEMO_SLUG' } });

{/*
  SECTION 1: Grid with Explanation + Code
  
  Left column: Key concepts as bullet points (5-8 bullets)
  Right column: Annotated code example with !mark highlights
  
  Guidelines:
  - Start with what the feature IS
  - Explain the key mechanism
  - Mention integration points
  - Highlight important patterns
*/}

<Grid>

# !!col

- **Primary concept** explained in one clear sentence.
- Secondary concept that builds on the first.
- How the feature integrates with the broader framework.
- Common patterns and best practices.
- Performance or UX considerations.

# !!col

```tsx app/example/page.tsx
// File path appears as the code block label

export default async function Page() {
  // !mark
  // Lines with !mark get highlighted
  const data = await fetchData();
  
  return <Component data={data} />;
}
```

</Grid>

{/*
  SECTION 2: Demo Instructions
  
  Guide users through the interactive demo with numbered steps.
  Each step should highlight a specific behavior or concept.
*/}

### Demo

1. **Action to take** and what to observe.
2. **Second interaction** with expected behavior.
3. **Edge case to try** demonstrating error handling or fallbacks.
4. **Comparison step** showing before/after or alternative behavior.

{/*
  SECTION 3: Visual Summary
  
  FlowDiagram provides a scannable mental model.
  - Title: Describes the flow in 3-5 words
  - Steps: 4-6 key stages in the process
  - Note: One-sentence clarification
*/}

### Visual Summary

<FlowDiagram
  title="Process name"
  steps={["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Result"]}
  note="Brief clarification of the overall flow or important consideration."
/>

{/*
  SECTION 4: Key Takeaways
  
  Table format for scannable reference.
  3-5 rows covering the most important guidance.
*/}

### Key Takeaways

| Topic | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| When to use | Specific scenarios where this feature shines |
